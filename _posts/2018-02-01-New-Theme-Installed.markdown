Still working on everything, but I finally have a new theme installed on the site and I am getting better at using git to get everything updated and working the way I need it to.

For example, this is what I have been working with in Git just trying to get this site running:

{% highlight ruby %}
$ git add .
$ git commit
	[master cf03026] color fixes
	1 file changed, 4 insertions(+), 4 deletions(-)
$ git push
	Counting objects: 3, done.
	Delta compression using up to 4 threads.
	Compressing objects: 100% (3/3), done.
	Writing objects: 100% (3/3), 341 bytes | 341.00 KiB/s, done.
	Total 3 (delta 2), reused 0 (delta 0)
	remote: Resolving deltas: 100% (2/2), completed with 2 local objects.
	To https://github.com/BearDooks/beardooks.github.io.git
	   bfb2649..cf03026  master -> master
{% endhighlight %}
