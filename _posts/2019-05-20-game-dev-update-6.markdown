## Working On Test Items

I know I have not posted an update to this for a while and there is good reason for that. I have been working on other projects, as well as small test cases for this game. I know it is not the best thing to be working on since I have a large backlog of items I really need to go through, but I really feel like I needed a break.

I dumped a large amount of time into this game when I first started making it and I got burnt out super quick.

Not really a surprise seeming that I am a one man team, and I am missing some key parts like sound and art. I have been getting anything I can from OpenGameArt.com or making really bad renditions of it in MSPaint. So if anyone is reading this and wants to help out let me know and I am more than happy to pull you into the "Team".

## Other Projects

As I had said before I am working on some other projects that have been taking up most of my free time, which granted is not a lot to start, so I have been behind on everything. I am not just ignoring this game. 

### Housework

I have been putting a lot of time into the house, where I am trying to repair / install / fix anything that is wrong. I still have to refinish the deck, and install new deck railings on both my deck, and the balcony deck. I also have a fence that is going to be installed in about three or so weeks, so that is going to be something. Here is a smaller list of everything else I need to do.

<ul>
<li>Cleanout Basement</li>
<li>Fix puddles that form in yard</li>
<li>Powerwash the house</li>
<li>Master bath is leaking</li>
</ul>

So there is a bit to do there.

### Arcade

For Father's Day this year I have asked for some time to work on my arcade in peace and quiet. No kids, wo wife, no mother in law bothering me. I have the tools I need, I have the plans I think? So it comes down to picking if I want just the pedestal, or do I want to build the full cabinet. I think I am leaning more towards the first option since it is easy to move around and I can plug it right into a TV on the wall without issue.

## Upcoming Work

I don't have much panned for this game in the future. I am still trying to nail down an artist, and maybe someone to help me program it. I think since I am the only one working on these projects, I don't always have that full investment into them, so it is easier for me to not work on it and be ok with that.
