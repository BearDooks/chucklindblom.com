Slack is a relatively new product in the market that has had some seriously amazing growth. The Team Communication app has not only broken into the market, it has taken it by storm.

## What Is Slack?

Slack is a team communication app at its core. What at first glance appears to be a simple chat room, or chat app is really much more more. From adding integration with other apps, to making special channel;s to discuss items that might not need to be in the general chat, Slack is your app.

## Channels:

Slack has the ability to let is users add channels to their account. Those channels are basically smaller chat rooms that can be used to discuss certain parts of a project, or a channel that can alert you when GitHub is updated. All in all it is a very powerful tool that lets DevOps and Engineers use the same application in different ways.

## Application Integration:

One fo the things Slack does best, is allow people to integrate their apps with it. The Slack API is open and available for anyone to use. I found a lot of use when I was working with Google Drive and GitHub. Slack would let me know when a new document was sent to me in Drive, or if a new version was pushed via Git. Otherwise if the people forget to tell me I could go days without knowing. A small list of apps that currently integrate are

  * Google Drive
  * Jira
  * GitHub
  * Jenkins

You can check out most of the other app integrations [HERE](https://slack.com/apps)

## Conclusion:

I really love Slack. I think it is one of the best tools to help teams collaborate on projects, and really get things working. Now if only I could find some people to use it more with me instead of my one or two friends that I code for fun with.
