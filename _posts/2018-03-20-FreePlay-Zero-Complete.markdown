# Freeplaytech Complete
So I finally was able to complete the FreePlay Zero build that I have been working on and I have to say i could not be happier with how it turned out. I had a few minor issues with it that I could have fixed with the use of better tools, but we will save that for the version 2.0 that I will be making.

With a 32GB SD Card inserted into it, I have a large number of my old favorite games running, and I let the scrapper run that is built into RetroPie so I have image art to go with it. The sound is decent considering how small the unit really is. I did have some issues with the X and Y buttons, but nothing that could not be fixed later.

I also made a small change to it where to exit the emulator, you hold the L button and press Select. This to me is a bit easier to explain to someone then holding the power button for 2 seconds, and then pressing Start and Select at the same time. 

Pictures to be posted soon I hope in a new post, just trying to clean up some of the dirt and whatnot.
