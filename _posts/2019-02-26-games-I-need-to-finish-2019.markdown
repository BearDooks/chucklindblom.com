In a recent conversation with a good friend of mine, we started to discuss games were are playing or need to play. As we went on, it became very apparent to the both of us that the list is huge and keeps growing. We just never seem to finish anything, or we play a game that is to long and by the time we truly get into the meat and bones of it, something else has come around.

I thought it might be an interesting idea to write them down so I could truly get an idea of the mountain in front of me. So for this, I plan to break it down into games I am playing, games I need to play, and games I am done with.

### Note that I am including links to buy these games. I AM NOT affiliated with amazon or steam, nor do I get money if you decide to buy the game. 

## List as of February 26th, 2019

This was just a fun stupid L4D clone that my buddy and I played through, loved 

This list doesnâ€™t even include the new games that have been announced. Tetris 99 while I have played, I kept off the list since it is more like play a few rounds when I have 5 minutes. The remaster of Links Awakening is coming out, which i am stoked for. Apex Legends is something I might want to play at some point. There are so many game son the horizon, and the backlog I put here is so small compared to what it really is.

How do people keep up with it. Send me a message <a href="https://twitter.com/lindblomchuck"> on twitter </a> and let me know what games are on your list or how you keep up with it.
