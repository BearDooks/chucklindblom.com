So this year my goal was to cut costs where ever I could. My old hosting provide was bleeding me dry for money, and I always seemed to have an issue with them. Enter [Jekyll][jekyll-engine], a free, simple, and lightweight way to blog using a github repo.

I have seen this before, and knew of a few people who were using it, but I had never tried it myself. Come to find out there are a ton of methods to install this 'software'. A large group of people have made repos on [Githib][github-site] that you can fork and just start using. I went a different approach and ran through the [offical install method][install-method].

I hope to have this tie up and running with more features, and plugins, but since I know almost nothing on using the GIT command line, I feel like I am learning everything all over again.
