So one of the biggest changes I have made in 2017 so far is this site. For starters I kicked in the new WordPress 2017 Theme. I really like the simple look and the functionality it brings to the table.

The second being I updated some of the plugins on the back-end, and removed some more.

## [Theme My Login:](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-my-login/)

This is probably one of my favorite plugins ever. I have been using WordPress for years now, and one of the biggest things that always got to me was the login page. A page not many people normally see if you run a blog by yourself, but still we need to show it some love. [Theme My Login](https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-my-login/) does exactly that. This plugin takes the CSS from the rest of your site and applies it to a new login page. It also through in some nice widgets to use instead of the standard META ones. I highly recommend it.

## [Yoast SEO:](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/)

I had a different SEO pack in 2015/2016 and I never really used it. A lot of the features were paid features, and the tools just didn&#8217;t fit the spot I needed them in. A quick Google search later and I find [Yoast SEO.](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) Once you install this plugin, it takes you through a very simple extremely easy to use configuration center. You plug in everything you want it to know about you and it does the rest.

## [SyntaxHighlighter Evolved:](https://wordpress.org/plugins/syntaxhighlighter/)

This is a plugin I didn&#8217;t really need, but it makes some of my pages and posts stick out nicely. My full time job requires a ton of my time, and I try to save as much of it as I can by writing scripts to automate a lot of what I do. I have posted some of these to the site here, but the page never really looked the way I wanted it to. This plugin adds the correct look and feel of the code so people can read it easily. I highly recommend anyone who puts any type of code on their site to look into something like this. You can easily turn this
