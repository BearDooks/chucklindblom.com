I admit that I am awful when it comes to keeping this site up and running. Well lets say I am more awful at writing things down, the site has been running fine ever since I moved it off of a cruddy personal server and into the cloud. I just need to make sure there are updates being done to the site.

I plan to change all this with some weekly updates. The updates themselves can be about anything from a game I might be working on, to some tech news, to nothing really at all. Point is I need to start writing more and I need to flesh this thing out.

I have some plans for the future, one of them being a new venture into Godot. A Co-Worker of mine brought this to my attention, and I am curious to see how it handles. Is it like Game Maker Studio? I guess we will find out.

So stay tuned, I hope to get this all coming together soon.
