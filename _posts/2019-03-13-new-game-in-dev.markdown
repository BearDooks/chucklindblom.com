Today Godot 3.1 was released to the general public. It just so happens that this morning I was talking to another developer I work with from time to time, and I said when 3.1 is released I have an idea for a new game. I just didn't think it was going to be released as soon as it was, egg on my face.

## I Guess I Can Call It Official

I will be starting a new project in Godot 3.1 today that I will hope to have done, or at least into a Beta by the end of July. This might be tough with the nice weather coming in around then, and some trips that I will be taking for work, but I would really like to get something else out there. LightsOut! was a fun game to make and release, but I think I rushed it to market.

## The Plan

My plan is pretty simple, keep the game smaller, and write the code so it works. I will worry about making it better later, but getting a working model is really what I need. To often I fall into this trap where I need to make the code as perfect as I can, and I get burnt out on these projects, so they never see the light of day.

As usual I will probably keep the game in BitBucket, keep a board on Trello, and write everything in Godot. My new plan is to make this game work on both Android and the Web. I may even be so bold as to make a Microsoft Windows port if I can. A lot has to do with how I will store the data for the game.

## Updates

I plan to release updates and screenshots of the game here as I work on it, but no promises how often that will be. I also plan to try and use my Twitter account to point back here for updates, or share GIFs out there.
